# MachineLearning
The aim is to build a predictive framework to frauds.
Frauds are a serious matter. The literature says that is much better spend 500 hours of manpower to detect a fraud, than turning a blind eye on a single fraud due to the financial cost of it.
Hence, this project aims to  predict frauds in a kaggle dataset with more than 1,000,000 transactions and compare the performance of different unsupervised and supervised algorithms.

The team will start with the pre-processing and cleansing of the data.
Next, every team member will adapt and tailor a specific ML algorithm to test the case of fraud or not.
Finally, the performance of different models will be compared by means of ROC curves.
